# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project that analyzes sentiment in tweets using both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning models.

## Overview

This project implements multiple machine learning models to classify tweet sentiments. It uses a labeled dataset of tweets to train and evaluate different classifiers for sentiment analysis and applies clustering techniques for unsupervised sentiment grouping.

## Models Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning

-   Decision Trees
-   Linear Regression
-   Logistic Regression
-   Random Forests
-   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-   Gradient Boosting
-   Naive Bayes

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning

-   K-Means Clustering
-   Hierarchical Clustering
-   Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

## Features

-   Text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization
-   5-fold cross-validation
-   Model performance comparison
-   ROC curves and AUC scores
-   Confusion matrices visualization
-   Comprehensive performance metrics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open `sentiment_analysis_supervised.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook for supervised models
4. Open `sentiment_analysis_unsupervised.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook for clustering approaches
5. Run the cells to see the analysis and results

## Dataset

The project uses the [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) from Kaggle, which contains labeled tweet data for training the models.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   scikit-learn
-   pandas
-   numpy
-   matplotlib
-   seaborn
