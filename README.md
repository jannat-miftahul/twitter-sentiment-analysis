# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project that analyzes sentiment in tweets using various supervised learning models.

## Overview

This project implements multiple machine learning models to classify tweet sentiments. It uses a labeled dataset of tweets to train and evaluate different classifiers for sentiment analysis.

## Models Implemented

- Decision Trees
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive Bayes

## Features

- Text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Model performance comparison
- ROC curves and AUC scores
- Confusion matrices visualization
- Comprehensive performance metrics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open `sentiment_analysis_supervised.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and results

## Dataset

The project uses Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset from Kaggle which contains labeled tweet data for training the models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
